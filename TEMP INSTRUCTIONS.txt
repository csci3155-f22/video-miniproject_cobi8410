GOAL: CONTROL BEE TO AVOID BEAR'S ATTACKS LONG ENOUGH TO TIRE IT OUT. THEN YOU CAN DELIVER ONE GOOD STING

GAMEPLAY: PROGRESS TOWARDS TIRING BEAR IS MARKED BY PROGRESS BAR AT TOP OF SCREEN. ONCE BEAR
IS TIRED IT WILL BECOME VULNERABLE. WHEN THE BEAR IS VULNERABLE, ONE OR MANY PARTS OF ITS BODY WILL CHANGE COLOR IN ONE OR MANY STATES TO INDICATE THAT YOU CAN NOW STING THEM. IF YOU STING THE BEAR IN A VULNERABLE PART, THE FIGHT WILL END AND YOU WILL WIN. IF THE BEAR HITS YOU WITH AN ATTACK (1), YOU WILL DIE AND LOSE THE FIGHT

CONTROLS: THERE ARE TWO MAIN MODES OF MOVEMENT...

GROUNDED = WALK BACK AND FORTH, BOUNCE OFF WALLS, PRESS SPACE TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS. CONSTANTLY BUILDS HONEY WHILE ON GRASS. HOLD SPACE TO BEGIN TAKEOFF AND START FLYING WITH YOUR POLINATOR JETPACK

AIR = NATURALLY FREEFALL DOWNWARD, BOUNCE OFF OF WALLS. WHEN FLYING HOLD SPACE TO SPEND HONEY AND ACCELERATE UPWARD. THE HONEY BAR CAN BE SEEN AT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. DOUBLE TAP SPACE TO FAST FALL DOWNWARD STRAIGHT DOWNWARD, CANCELING HORIZONTAL MOMENTUM AND SPENDING ALL HONEY. IF YOU RUN OUT OF HONEY WHILE IN AIR, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO BOOST UPWARDS OR FASTFALL, AND WILL FREEFALL UNTIL YOU HIT THE GROUND. HITTING THE GROUND TRANSITIONS YOU TO THE GROUNDED STATE

ATTACKING THE BOSS: WHEN THE BOSS IS VULNERABLE YOU CAN TAP SPACE IN AIR WHILE TOUCHING THE VULNERABLE BODY PART TO STING IT AND WIN THE FIGHT. NOTE: UNLIKE WITH FASTFALLING, YOU DO NOT NEED HONEY TO STING, ONLY TO BE TOUCHING THE BODY PART AND TAP SPACE

TO NAVIGATE MENUS, TAP SPACE TO MOVE CURSOR, HOLD SPACE TO SELECT
